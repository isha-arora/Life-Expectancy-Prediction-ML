The main objective of this project is to determine the life expectancy of a population in a particular country. The output will be continuous values and determining the most important features and same using them to train our linear regression model and binary classification
I have used Python language to train and test the linear Regression Model. The Life Expectancy is divided into 2 categories: Above Average and Below Average.
